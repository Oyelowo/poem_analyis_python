Title :Text Analysis
Note : This module was created to analyse a poem but can be used for other
        articles too. It mainly performs the below functions:
        1. Read the text with option of deleting the title
        2. creating a list of words in the text.
        3. creating a list of time difference(delta) time between words, when reading.
        4. introuces time axis to the text.
        5. create and export a dataframe with all the words in the poem. Each word
            has its frequency of occurence and average waiting distance. Average waiting
            distance is the average time between occurences of same word.
        6. these dataframe can also be sorted in ascending or descending order,
            according to the frequency(count) or average waiting time.
        7. it can also create dictionary with each word as a key and its cumulative time
            as the value.
